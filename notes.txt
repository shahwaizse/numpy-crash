numpy is used to create and manipulate matrices, which are the main data structure used by ML algorithms.

matrices representation varies, but generally:
python -> lists
numpy -> arrays
tensorflow -> tensors

maths operations on matrices have strict rules related to dimensions of the operands, so numpy uses something called broadcasting.
broadcasting resizes the operands so they can be added, subtracted, multiplied, etc.

noise is artificial deviation introduced to the dataset to make it more realistic.
